# Summary

UD_Wolof-WTB is a natively manual developed treebank for Wolof. Sentences were collected from encyclopedic, fictional, biographical, religious texts and news.

# Introduction
UD_Wolof-WTB was developed 2018-2019 at the University of Bergen. The treebank contains around 43,000 tokens taken from a variety of genres (encyclopedic, informative, narrative, didactic, and expository). UD_Wolof-WTB is annotated for POS tag, morphological information and dependency relations. As the language shows complex interaction between morphology and cliticization, clitics have been segmented manually.

The treebank contains articles taken from the following sources:
OSAD (http://www.osad-sn.com): 6 articles (6269 tokens)
Wolof Online http://www.wolof-online.com: 18 articles (12988 tokens)
Wolof Wikipedia (https://wo.wikipedia.org): 12 articles (9232 tokens)
Xibaaryi.com (http://www.xibaaryi.com): 17 articles (15095 tokens)
For each of the four sources, one half of the documents were assigned to the training corpus. Likewise, 1/4 of the documents from each source was respectively assigned to the development and the test corpus. The data split was done with caution with the aim to preserve contiguous texts in the different splits and also to keep a balance of genres in each of the splits.

# Acknowledgments
